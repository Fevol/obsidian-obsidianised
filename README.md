A plugin for <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> that aims to make your notes and entire workflow
much more resilient against misclicks, accidental deletions, and other user errors. <br>
No more shall you lose your precious text due to a slip of the finger!

## Installation

Install **_now_** via either:

- [**BRAT**](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)**:** Run `Add a beta plugin for testing` with url `https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-obsidianised`.
- **Manually:** create a folder `.obsidian/plugins/obsidianised`, add `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest release to the new folder.


## Uninstallation
Not happy with the added resilience that this plugin offers? <br>
Do you not like having a safety net? <br>
Would you rather prefer to live life on the edge, with the constant (non-zero) possibility of an _oopsie_-_woopsie_-i-accidentally-managed-to-delete-my-entire-vault scale event?

For your convenience, the
plugin can now be disabled with just a single click via the plugin settings or via the `Disable Obsidianised` command!

> [!WARNING]
> This does mean that it is entirely possible to disable the plugin by accident, without
> intending to do so. So be very careful when hovering over the enable/disable Obsidianised toggle button in the settings page!

Or, you can also just remove the plugin via the file explorer, whatever floats your boat, I guess.


## Legal Disclaimer

1. By downloading, installing, or even thinking about installing this plugin (henceforth referred to as "the Plugin"), you (affectionately referred to as "the User") hereby agree to absolve the creators, developers, maintainers, and anyone remotely associated with the Plugin (collectively, diminutively, referred to as "the Creators") of any responsibility for the existential crisis, emotional distress, repetitive strain injuries, or recurrent Minecraft addiction that may ensue from its use.
2. You understand and acknowledge that while the Plugin endeavors to maintain the integrity of your data, the User (inanenly) may still unintentionally or not delete, modify, burn, break, vaporize, mangle, obliterate, or otherwise wreak havoc upon their notes. The Plugin offers multiple safeguards to prevent calamities of this nature, but the User (malignantly) should nevertheless exercise caution when interacting with the App.
3. The Plugin will in no way, shape, form, dimension, reality, or parallel universe, be able to recover (or similarly resurrect) lost data that was deleted by the User (obdurately), the App (neutrally), _other_ Plugins (snidely) or Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (unintentionally). The Creators recommend that the User (prudently) maintain regular backups of their notes regardless of use of the plugin.
4. The Creators shall not be held responsible for any unintended consequences resulting from the User's attempts to outsmart the Plugin's Ring-1e99 level Anti-Cheat Nefarious Engineâ„¢; including but not limited to: the Plugin getting peeved, passive-aggressive messages appearing in the console, or (unlikely) the Plugin gaining sentience and taking over the world.
5. The Creators reserve the right to update, modify, discontinue or mark the Plugin as abandon-ware at any time without warning. The time-frame for these event lie anywhere between the first public beta announcement of this plugin, and the closing of the kalends mensis Aprilis, anno Domini MMXXIV -- roundabout UTC-12 midnight or something in that general neighborhood.
